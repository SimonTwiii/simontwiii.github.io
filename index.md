## 📖 Overview
Public safety resources are often limited. Predictive policing needs not just data, but ethical and actionable intelligence. This project analyzes over 27,000 records from the NYPD Shooting Incident Dataset. It builds a classification model that predicts whether a shooting incident might be fatal.

The goal is to identify risk factors—such as time, location, and demographics—that contribute to fatalities. This enables law enforcement and community leaders to allocate resources thoughtfully and proactively instead of reactively.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Core Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes)
- **Data Handling:** SMOTE for class imbalance, TargetEncoder, StandardScaler
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib for heatmaps and geo-clustering
- **Business Tools:** PowerPoint for stakeholder presentations
